          <p>We offer a range of research programs covering many areas including:</p>
          <h4>PhD</h4>
          <p>The Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) involves the student independently researching a specific topic under the guidance of a supervisor. This research involves critical and creative activities and disciplined methods of inquiry designed to increase the stock of human knowledge.
          </p>
          <h4>Master of Philosophy</h4>
          <p>The Master of Philosophy is also a supervised research program involving the independent research of a specific topic under the guidance of a supervisor. The candidate must undertake an original investigation which would normally be more limited in scope and degree of originality than for a PhD.
          </p>
          <h4>Research Masters with Training</h4>
          <p>The Research Masters with Training is an 18 month full time degree designed for students for whom additional, or specialised, research training is desirable. It is suitable for industry professionals who seek to extend and deepen their research expertise and undertake research relevant to their professional field; and those hoping to proceed to a higher degree but lacking in the conventional background.
          </p>
          <h4>Master of Education (Research)</h4>
          <p>Students studying the Master of Education (MEd) undertake a research dissertation combined with a limited number of coursework units to both inform their dissertation and provide an appropriate methodology background. This course is designed to provide the education profession and the community with leaders capable of addressing critical issues in educational practice, policy and research.
          </p>
          <h4>Doctor of Education</h4>
          <p>The Doctor of Education is an intensive course of study consisting of coursework and applied research in a selected area of practice leading to a dissertation that contributes conceptually and practically to the profession.
          </p>
          <h4>Master of Laws (Research)</h4>
          <p>The Master of Laws (LLM) is designed to extend the opportunity for law students to undertake research at an advanced level.
          </p>
          <h4>Master of Applied Psychology + PhD</h4>
          <p>This combined course is offered to students wishing to combine professional training at Master's level in Clinical or Organisational Psychology with compatible research at the PhD level. It combines thorough, professional training in the chosen area of specialisation with the high level of research training associated with doctoral-level studies.
